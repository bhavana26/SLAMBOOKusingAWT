As we know JAVA Abstract Window Tool Kit is an API to develop GUI or
Window Applications in JAVA ,In this project we need to create an online Slam
Book Application in which there will be three windows in the first one will be
the userâ€™s choice to either write or read a slam and if the user clicks on the
button To Write A Slam then the window should pop up with the text area in
which file the user wanted to write a slam and then all the details are filled by
the user and then he clicks the SAVE Button and the details are stored in a file
which will be appear on the default directory and then if the user clicks the Read
A Slam button then the file from which he wants to read will be entered then all
the details are then displayed in the Text Area.
